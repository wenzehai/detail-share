## 项目简介

一个分享商品详情的网站，为普通用户提供免费高质量的商品详情图片，
为商家提供一个良好的品牌形象展示平台。

## 项目初衷

To develop an application using popular technology,
you need to use many third-party libraries and frameworks,
you need to take the time to learn it.

The current web environment is quite different from the past.
High compatibility between browsers(but you still need to pay attention),
also supports es6 modules, and webcomponent.

Can we use the functionality provided by the web to complete an app? let try.

## 技术架构

- HTTP2
- ES6 Modules ([jspm](https://jspm.io/))
- JSDoc
- Web Component
- Template engine: [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html)(No virtual DOM diffing)
